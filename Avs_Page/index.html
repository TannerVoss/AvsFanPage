            <h3>Team Mascot - Bernie</h3>
            <p>
                Name: Bernie <br> Breed: St. Bernard<br> NHL Debut: October 3, 2009<br> Birthplace: Summit County<br> Hometown: Denver, Colorado<br> Home: Bernie's Dog Park on Main Concourse, Ball Arena<br> Height: 6'5"<br>
                <br> Bernie, was born in Summit County in a litter of five puppies. His brothers and sisters loved playing in the snow but Bernie kept running to the hockey rink at the base of the mountain. After many attempts to bring Bernie back to
                the slopes, the Ski Patrol knew his love was really ice not snow. The Patrol brought Bernie to an Avalanche home game where he saw a perfect sheet of NHL ice. And it was love at first sight. Bernie had found his new home.<br>
                <br> Bernie now stands as the proud mascot for the Colorado Avalanche. True to his breed, Bernie is devoted to his team as a symbol of integrity, strength and loyalty. Beware of drool, it is unavoidable. He is a gentle giant amongst the
                community for all ages.<br></p>

            <h3>Howler the Yeti</h3>
            <p>
                Howler the Yeti was the first mascot for the Colorado Avalanche when they became a team in 1995. He served as the mascot until a game against the Chicago Blackhawks in 1999. During a "fracas" in the stands, Howler was accused by a fan named Linda Sprehe
                of injuring her arm and stomach. The unnamed employee inside the costume and Sprehe were each cited for disturbing the peace. After this incident, Howler was retired and the team went without a mascot for almost years.
