                Stingrays after going undrafted by the NHL in 1995, then proceeded to have a small stint in the AHL with the St. John’s Maple Leafs and Rochester Americans followed by a single season (98-99) in the IHL with the Grand Rapids Griffins.
                He then rejoined the Stingrays for 3 seasons before retiring. <br> After his playing career, Jared immediately began his coaching career as the assistant coach for the Stingrays from 2002-2007 before being named head coach
                for the 07-08 season. His first season as head coach yielded much success, making it to the 3rd round of the Kelly Cup. The following season, the Stingrays went on to win the Kelly Cup. Bednar stepped down as coach following the success
                of the season and moved to an assistant coach position for the Abbotsford Heat in the AHL for their debut season, then became the head coach of the Peoria Rivermen in the AHL for 2 seasons. In 2012, Bednar was hired as the assistant coach
                for the Springfield Falcons, the AHL affiliate team of the Columbus Blue Jackets. After 2 seasons, he was promoted to head coach and then transferred to the Lake Erie Monsters when the Blue Jackets affiliation shifted to the Cleveland
                AHL team for the 2015-2016 season, during which the team would tear through the playoffs and win the Calder Cup with a playoff record of 15-2. <br> Following this success, Bednar was named head coach of the Colorado Avalanche following
                the departure of Patrick Roy. His first year went extremely poorly, something Bednar’s coaching record did not usually reflect. The Avalanche finished last overall in the league and had the worst season since becoming a team. The following
                season (2017-2018), Bednar began to reach his stride. The Avalanche qualified for the playoffs but were knocked out in the first round. The next season (2018-2019) the Avs again reached the playoffs, making it to the 2nd round, a trend
                that has continued through the 2020-2021 season.

            <h3>Team Mascot - Bernie</h3>
            <p>
                Name: Bernie <br> Breed: St. Bernard<br> NHL Debut: October 3, 2009<br> Birthplace: Summit County<br> Hometown: Denver, Colorado<br> Home: Bernie's Dog Park on Main Concourse, Ball Arena<br> Height: 6'5"<br>
                <br> Bernie, was born in Summit County in a litter of five puppies. His brothers and sisters loved playing in the snow but Bernie kept running to the hockey rink at the base of the mountain. After many attempts to bring Bernie back to
                the slopes, the Ski Patrol knew his love was really ice not snow. The Patrol brought Bernie to an Avalanche home game where he saw a perfect sheet of NHL ice. And it was love at first sight. Bernie had found his new home.<br>
                <br> Bernie now stands as the proud mascot for the Colorado Avalanche. True to his breed, Bernie is devoted to his team as a symbol of integrity, strength and loyalty. Beware of drool, it is unavoidable. He is a gentle giant amongst the
                community for all ages.<br></p>

            <h3>Howler the Yeti</h3>
            <p>
                Howler the Yeti was the first mascot for the Colorado Avalanche when they became a team in 1995. He served as the mascot until a game against the Chicago Blackhawks in 1999. During a "fracas" in the stands, Howler was accused by a fan named Linda Sprehe
                of injuring her arm and stomach. The unnamed employee inside the costume and Sprehe were each cited for disturbing the peace. After this incident, Howler was retired and the team went without a mascot for almost years.
